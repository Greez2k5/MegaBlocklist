# MegaBlocklist
Merged Megablocklist for PiHole

I merged many blocklists that i found into one big MegaBlocklist.
It´s not perfect and i probably won´t update it.
You will have to whitelist some services you use because i didn´t filtered the list for now.
Maybe i will delete entries that i am using myself or i will delete some generell domains.

I got no clue how Github really works and how to handle big files, so i uploaded the list otherways in case it didn´t work. Just copy the link and paste it to your addlist: https://mylittleplatoon.de/files/megablocklist.txt

I just added a Whitelist that i created that works fine for me (no Apple support!)
